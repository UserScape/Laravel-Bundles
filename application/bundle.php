| Auto-Loader Mappings
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Larave uses a simple array of class to path mappings to drive the class
| auto-loader. This simple approach helps avoid the performance problems
| of searching through directories by some kind of convention. It also
| gives you the freedom to organize your application how you want.
|
| Registering a mapping couldn't be easier. Just pass an array of class
| to path maps into the "map" function of Autoloader. Then, when you
| want to use that class, just use it. It's a piece of cake.
