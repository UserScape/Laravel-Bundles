Bundles:

- Authentication (!)
- ORM (!)
- HTML Generation
- Form Generation
- Pagination

HTML Generation is needed for pagination, but if pagination goes it is no longer necessary.
How do we spoof PUT and DELETE requests without a Form generation library. Also, how do we
provide CSRF protection.

Extremely simple Form generation has to exist in some form I think.

If pagination is gone, how do we attach methods to the query builder?

Laravel\Database\Query::attach('for_page', function($query, $something, $else)
{
	return $query->take()
});

Laravel 3.0 Outstanding

- Form and HTML helpers need to go pretty much
- pagination and validation needs to go?
- Move inflection code into Str class.
- Some way to map bundles to other directories?
